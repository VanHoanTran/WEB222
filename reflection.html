                <h2>What I learned from WEB222</h2>
                <p>&emsp;Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a new trend in which the web design and
                    development process will
                    respond to any user's device and environment according to the device screen size and orientation
                    criteria. To do that we will use a flexible combination of techniques including flexible grid,
                    responsive image, and CSS media query. When users switch from their laptop to iPad or iPhone, the
                    web page automatically is converted to fit the screen size and reorganize its content. In other
                    words, websites need to have technology that automatically responds to the user's device. This will
                    eliminate multiple designs for a website and reduce time and costs.</p>

                <p>&emsp;Nowadays, designers are combining fluid layout, flexible images, responsive navigation,
                    and CSS media query to create a Responsive Web. </p>
                <p>&emsp;We can use a feature in CSS3 that is the media query to create a fluid layout and
                    flexible content. The min-width and max-width properties do exactly what we recommend to accommodate
                    the size of a device's screen and browser. The min-width attribute sets the browser and screen to a
                    minimum width according to a certain set of styles that fit the device to that minimum width. If a
                    device with screen size is below this limit, the stylesheets will be ignored. The max-width property
                    does the opposite. Any device whose browser or maximum screen width exceeds the specified limits
                    will not apply the corresponding stylesheets. The following code will automatically change the web
                    page background color according to different device sizes.</p>
                <p>&emsp;If the image size is too small, the image will appear in low quality, However, we still want it
                    to appear on the web and
                    do not want to discard it because it is important. Because of that reason, images are divided into 2
                    groups: one group
                    can cut out the unimportant parts and the other group will keep the image but will be zoomed in or
                    out.
                    There are many techniques used to create flexible images that are responsive to different screen
                    sizes.
                    There are 3 different ways to achieve the goal.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using stylesheet with img{max-width: 100%;}</li>
                    <li>Using HTML5 and javascript elements.</li>
                    <li>Using Cloud services.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                    &emsp;A responsive navigation bar is a new form of navigation bar that can be displayed on many
                    different
                    screen sizes such as phones, tablets, laptops, PCs. For each type of device, they will be displayed
                    differently for the best fit.
                </p>

                    &emsp;Web222 provided me plenty of new things about designing a website on my own.
                    I learned how to use JavaScript programming language to define and modify a webâ€™s structure and
                    its content, validate input from users.
                    CSS is stored in external CSS files so an entire website can be changed by changing just one file.
                    Using CSS eliminates the need to repeat descriptions for each element. We can save time by using CSS
                    to make up a website, making the code shorter, making it easier to control unnecessary errors.CSS
                    creates many different styles that can be applied to many websites, thereby it helps to reduce
                    repetition of the same formats in different websites.
                    I learned how to use HTML to build structured hypertext on a web page or declare digital files
                    (media) such as images, videos, music. HTML is often used to separate paragraphs, headings, links,
                    etc.
